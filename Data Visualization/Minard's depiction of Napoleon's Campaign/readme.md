# Minard's depiction of Napoleon's Campaign

Minard is best known for his cartographic depiction of numerical data on a map of Napoleon's disastrous losses suffered during the Russian campaign of 1812 (in French, Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l'Armée Française dans la campagne de Russie 1812–1813). The illustration depicts Napoleon's army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon's troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard's interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers.

### The chart has been reconstructed in Processing 3
The data consists of 3 different sets of information which have been broken in 3 different csv files for ease of use.
- Path of the army along with the strength, division and direction(attacking or retreating)
- Temperature recorded along specific co-ordinates
- City names and co-ordinates of their centers
