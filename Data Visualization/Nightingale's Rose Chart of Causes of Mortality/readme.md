# Nightingale's rose chart to show causes of mortality in the army in the east

This "Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East" was published in Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency, and Hospital Administration of the British Army and sent to Queen Victoria in 1858.

This graphic indicates the number of deaths that occured from preventable diseases (in red), those that were the results of wounds (in purple), and those due to other causes (in green).

### The chart has been reconstructed in Processing 3
The data consists of reasons of mortality and the number of deaths by month.

###### A Static version of the visualisation is shown below

Both the rose charts depict the same data but the one of the right has been slightly rotated and zoomed in to show flexibility for change.

#### Code Features
- Data filtering: The code provides the option of selecting the starting month from which 12 months will be selected to create the chart.
- Parametrized scaling: In case the data isn't clear in the chart, the chart can be zoomed by changing a single parameter.
- Animations:
        - Clockwork: The chart rotates either by a key input or automatically
        - Zoom: The chart zooms in and out

###### The Processing sketch can also be animated to rotate the diagram by clicking the "a" key. The animation would look as shown in the video below
